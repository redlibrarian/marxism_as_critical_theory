Conference theme: Power to the people.
Etymology: democracy
Soundbites: Canadian Regime, Ditzion, Buschman, other recent stories. OIF.
Two questions: who are "the people" and where is power held/what kind of
power is it? Over political history, the concept of the people has
expanded (franchise), but the site of political power has remained
essentially unchanged. I see this as ideological: as a way to limit the
"official" exercise of power in order to allow power to be exercised
elsewhere along non-liberal lines. The liberal-democratic theory applies
to "political life" but not to "civil society". If we want more power to
the people then we need to extend our understanding of political power
out into civil society. But in order to do this we need to reconcile the
contradiction between "ethics" (politics as applied ethics) and
"neutrality" or, if you like, collective responsibility vs. individual
freedom.
