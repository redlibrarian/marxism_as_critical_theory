          <p>Born: Trier, Prussia, 1818. Died: 1883, London, England.</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            Originally studied law, but became interested in philosophy.
            Worked in journalism where he fell foul of the authorities
            and had to leave Prussia. Settled first in Belgium, and then
            in London. In London he took advantage of the collections of
            the British Museum library to study politics and
            economics.
          
            It was his work in journalism that first got him interested
            in political economy and the condition of the poor and the
            working class. In London he was able to study the most
            advanced form of capitalism then in existence.

            In 1847, he and his friend Friedrich Engels wrote *The
            Manifesto of the Communist Party* for the International
            Working Men's Association just in time for the 1848
            revolutions which swept Europe.

            In the Communist Manifesto, Marx and Engels laid out what
            they saw as the fundamental problems of capitalism
            (exploitation, poverty, etc.) and,
            according to a theory of history which they had developed,
            predicted its overthrow by a workers' revolution.

          <p>Philosophers have hitherto only <em>interpreted</em> the world in
          various ways; the point is to <em>change</em> it.</p>

          <aside class="notes">This has enormous implications for the
            relationship of theory to practice. For Marx and subsequent
            Marxism theory and praxis have to be a unified thing.
            Gramsci referred to Marxism in his prison notebooks as "the
            philosophy of praxis".</aside>

          <p>Marxist Critical Theory</p>
          <aside class="notes">Usually associated with the Frankfurt
            School of Social Research, which included members Theodore
            Adorno, Marx Horkheimer, Herbert Marcuse, and Jurgen
            Habermas.

            Frankfurt School distinguished between "scientific theory"
            and "critical theory".

          <p>Scientific Theory:</p>

              the external world."</li>
            <li>Objectifying: "one can distinguish clearly between the

              that coercion."</li>
            <li>Reflective or self-referential: "a critical theory is
              always part of the object-domain which it describes;

              themselves.</li>

            Three sources: German philosophy, French socialism, English
            political economy. A Marxist critical theory should stake
            its claims with respect to these three subjects: philosophy,
            politics, and political economy.</aside>

          <aside class="notes">Not just a philosophy or mission for
            librarianship, but questioning the fundamental assumptions
            of the profession and ourselves. When we talk about
            "intellectual freedom", for example, what do we mean by
            "freedom"? What is the philosophical history of that idea
            within the profession or within society?

            But also, questions of ontology: what are the objects that
            compose our world? Individuals? Social classes? What do we
            mean by "identity"? These kinds of questions are vital and
            are often ignored when we concentrate on concrete aspects of
            our work, or when we don't critically challenge hegemonic
            discourses.</aside>

              world, our parent institutions, our patrons or users? How
              do we reach decisions? Are we collegially or hiearchically

              and what are the consequences of that? Who do we privilege
              or exploit? Who do we include or exclude? Whose voices do
              we hear or not hear? How do we relate to politics more
              broadly, for example with respect to Indigenous
              sovereignty or pipeline expansion? What are the political
            presumptions and consequences of free speech or intellectual
            freedom? (cf. "first amendment" vs. "charter of rights and
            freedoms"). What are the positions of people of colour,
